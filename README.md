# UAV_Design
#This is basic scipting for fixed wing UAV design mainly sizing of the UAVs

1.   Thermophysical properties can be evaluated by calling the function modules (temp, pressure, density).
2.   Weight Estimation Iteration for optimization in Weight of battery & Weight of propulsion unit.
3.   Sizing of the planform based on Wing loading, Lift to drag ratio, and Aspect Ratio.
4.   By plotting the graphs and analysing them at different parameter variations, a better choice can be made to optimize the design of UAV.

All of this is included in the scripts!
